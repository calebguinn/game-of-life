        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            The Game of Life was created by British Mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is also
          known as Life or John Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a 2-dimensional cellular
          automaton that follows a simple set of rules that have the ability to produce complex
          patterns and simulated biological life. The original game was created by Conway with the
          idea of creating a "universal" cellular automaton where unpredictable patterns could
          evolve. From years of experiments with variations of rules, the Game of Life was 
          eventually created and published in a 1970 issue of Scientific American and has since
          grown tremendously in popularity.

          Since the first publication of the game, the Game of Life and the patterns that evolve
          from the simple rules governing it have been extensively documented and studied by people
          all around the world. The reason for the interest in the game comes from the complex
          patterns that have been produced using the rules of it as well as the fact that the 
          Game of Life is theoretically a universal Turing machine. Being a universal Turing machine
          means that any computation done by a computer could also theoretically be done using a 
          very large Game of Life board.
